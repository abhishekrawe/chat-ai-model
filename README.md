# 💖SoulAI - chat with AI

This Project is an assignment  which is build using [ReactJs](https://react.dev/) , [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/) .

# 🤡The Problem statement is -

- Implement an application where the user can chat with an AI model. 
- Beyond this, the user should be able to give some feedback at each stage of the conversation

## 🎀 Do you want it on local ?🎀 

1. clone this repository
- modelbackend
- modelfrontend

2. **For running the Backend**
```bash
cd to modelbackend
npm install
npm node index.js
```

3. **For running the Frontend** 
```bash
cd to modelfrontend
npm install
npm run start
```
4. Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend. 
- View the frontend result by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- View the frontend result by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## 🍨Reasoning behind your design choices:

- The reasoning behind our design choices stems from the primary goal of creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface like ChatGPT. 
Our homepage features a straightforward layout with a sidebar and a central chat section.
We opted for a minimalist design approach to prevent overwhelming users with too many options.

- The past conversation section organizes chats into groups, allowing users to easily navigate through saved conversations. 
We incorporated a rating system for filtering conversations, enhancing the user experience without cluttering the interface with unnecessary elements.

- Avoiding a tabular structure was a deliberate choice, as it wouldn't complement the conversational nature of the platform. 
Instead, we focus on capturing feedback at the end of each conversation.
